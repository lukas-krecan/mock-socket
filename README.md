Mock Socket
===========

**This project is effectively dead. If you need HTTP mocking, I can recommend [Jadler](http://jadler.net)**

Mock Socket project is here to help you with testing of your Java Socket related code. It has two parts

* [Core](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/mock-socket/wiki/Core-API) - code for mocking of general Java sockets
* [HTTP](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/mock-socket/wiki/HTTP) - support for text based HTTP socket testing
